## Reflection

This industry talk has opened my eyes about the importance of both system development and project management in the computer science industry.
Inside this industry, the speaker emphasizes a lot about the importance of project planning, starting from the ideas, then to the designing
of the complex solution to the problem, and finally to the testing. He also talks about the importance of good teamwork skills to prevent 
any chaotic problems occurring within the team synergy. Other than that, I also learned about various types of skills that I need to master,
such as problem-solving skills, programming language skills, and more. The reason for this is that, as stated by the speaker, these skills 
will be implemented in industry, not only on the FYP Project in the final years, but also later on. 
Therefore, I will definitely use the information and advice given by him to apply it in my future workforce.

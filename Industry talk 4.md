The diverse applications of PPG in various coating sectors including industrial, packaging, and protective & marine coatings were presented. Through this presentation, it was learned that the PPG industry encompasses a vast range of everyday products, from food packaging to household items like mugs and plates.
The importance of the Power BI Centre of Excellence (CoE) for governance and documentation within the PPG industry was also highlighted. This Power BI CoE is frequently utilized to enhance the data and analytics experience across the organization.Finally, the process of transforming raw data into readable formats was explained through a "dessert-making" metaphor, the ingredients which represented by sales and customer data.The suppliers act as the data sources (SQL Server and SAP), the logistics represented by the network infrastructure (Internet, VPN, and LAN).

## Reflection 

In this industry talk, Miss Qaisara Rohzan, as the application developer anaylyst ii given us some exposure on how the PPG industry works. She present about how PPG works in coatings such as, industrial coatings, packaging coatings, and protective & marine coatings.
With this, I learn that there's so much that PPG industry covers in the products that we use everyday either its between food packaging or items like mug and plate. Miss Qaisara also stated the importance of Power BI CoE 
for governance and documentation in the PPG Industry. This Power BI CoE is being used often to enhance more data and analytics experience in PPG. Finally, Miss Qaisara teach about how these data is being transformed into much
readable for the company by using making a dessert as a metaphor, such as given ingredients for the sales data, customer data. Then, the suppliers is the data sources for SQL Server and SAP, the logistics for the network like the internet, VPN, and LAN.
The freezer as the storage for the database, and final path is the baking appliances like the hardware, like servers, and cloud compute. With these new knowledge, I gained a lot of insight on how the industries worked.![photo_2026-01-20_17-54-47](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc374248-e62d-49ff-9304-cfc0ca613815)

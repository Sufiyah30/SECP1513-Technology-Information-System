## Reflections 

The visit to UTMDigital was very helpful and beneficial because it shows us how technology are applied in actual real life.
It helped connect of what we learn in class with how it's applied in actual organization. this activity has an impact of the
course bcs it shows us the real role of managing data and digital services. From this activity I also learn many impactful 
things like how UTMDigital manages systems and services in this university. This definitely made me more excited about the field.
Finally,I think that attending the talk help me understand the course better because it help me visualize more industry system

Reflection 

I think the PPG talk really gave me a lot of valuable information that makes me see clearly about the career path and daily 
routine of a data engineer. Besides that, the speakers really highlight the important skills and programs that need to be mastered 
in this industry. This talk also enhance more about the understanding of
how the company operates daily and how collaborative teamwork occurs daily in building and developing projects daily.

## Reflection

n this lab, we disassemble and assemble back PC to study further into the depth and the organization of materials that’s contain inside the PC. I learn about the positions of each structure, like the motherboard, the RAM, and more. I also learn in details on how to assemble the PC to avoid further damage when building it.
